## PLUMECALC
**Convolution-Based Particle Tracking (CBPT) method for FEHM flow and transport models**
**LANL Copyright No. C11064**
**LANL Documents: LA-UR-11-02090**

The PLUMECALC application determines resident or flux-averaged concentrations in groundwater flow models using the results from a random-walk particle tracking model simulation. The model assumes that the particle tracking simulation accurately characterizes the transport solution to the Advection-Dispersion equation (ADE) for one or more source locations. These particle tracking results, combined with solute input information such as mass flux input functions, sorption, diffusion, and decay parameters, are used to resolve the concentration within the model system or at fluid exit points. The code was initially developed to be compatible with the FEHM fluid flow and random- walk particle tracking model (Dash, 2003).
