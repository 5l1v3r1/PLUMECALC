VERS_V2.3.3 RELEASE NOTES:

The manual V2.3.2 was not updated because the updates did not change
how the code is run or basic functionality. Updated Figures can be
seen in Complex_subgrid_figures.pdf. See discussion below. 

-------
Response to query for differences between V2.3.2 and V2.3.3
From Zora Dash to Ian Nienhueser May 2011

The latest version of PLUMECALC corrects the subgridding issue identified 
by Dennis Fryar.  The problem was found when using subgridding in PLUMECALC V2.3.2 
on a simple model that used FEHM streamline particle tracking with dispersion. 
The problem of over estimating the concentration was identified as an
implementation issue related to when the delay applied due to diffusion was
computed. In the original implementation of mobile concentrations, the time
delay was calculated before any subgridding occurred. This lead to an over
calculation of concentration no matter what level of subgridding was used.
This problem has been corrected by doing the time delay calculations after the
subgridding. 
See subgrid_problem.doc

-------
 
This version also implements a modified integration scheme for the source term 
function. We identified problems in the numerical integration scheme 
when small decay constants were used, especially if the source term 
wasn't constant but was increasing or decreasing. I have rerun all of my 
test cases and found that there are only minor differences in results 
due to the modified integration scheme. 

Test cases were rerun with this version V2.3.3.  Of particular interest 
are the test results associated with the complex grid subgrid example documented 
in Sections 6.3.2 and 6.3.3 of the Users Manual (Dash et al, 2011)
Figures 32 to 39 (and specifically Figures 35, 37, 38 and 39).
With exception of the case run with both dispersion and diffusion,
as expected, there are no visually discernable differences.

@19:be83f4de2fec  	20 months	zvd	
Modified code to comput time delays after subgridding when subgridding is invoked. Modified decay calculations to better handle small decay constants (large half-lifes), numerical integration was blowing up due to formulation.
